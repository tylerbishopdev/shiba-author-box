# shiba-author-box
* Reusable Block Name:       Shiba Author Box
* Author Website URI:        https://internetery.com
* Description: Simple block template part that can be added easily as a reuable block in block-editors or block themes inside WordPress. No added external JS or CSS. This should only use existing theme styles and defaults and can be customized to fit any existing page templates. Should work with any sites that use Gutenberg blocks or a block editor. Not tested on old versions of WordPress. Go to posts or bulk change posts you'd like a basic author box added to and select the Shiba Author Box template and bam, it does the rest.
